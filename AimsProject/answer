Question: If you create constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?
Answer: Yes, we can overload constructor by providing it with different parameter lists and create multiple constructor methods for a class
Question: What class should implement the Comparable interface?
Answer: The Media class since its the base class for all products in cart and store
Question: In those class, how should you implement the compareTo() method to reflect the ordering that we want?
Answer: We would first compare this object with the passing object by title, if their title is the same, we then compare by cost
Question: Can we have two ordering rules of the item( by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
Answer: No we can not since the Comparable only have one compareTo() method so we can only implement one way of ordering.
Question: Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Answer: I would have DVD class to override the compareTo() method
